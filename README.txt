Creating a WordPress Theme from Scratch

- I set up the entire WordPress structure from scratch.
- I created an asset folder where I placed all the necessary styles.
- I added a gulp folder and initiated Sass, then wrote a gulpfile.js to specify which files to watch. I installed npm and gulp, and configured gulp to minify the files.
- I built the basic pages: header, footer, page, front-page, etc. I styled the menu and pages to have a decent appearance.
- I created a custom template for testing purposes and applied some page styling to it.
- I developed a simple blog page, including archive, single-archive, and single pages.
- I implemented a sidebar and search functionality.
- Naturally, I created the functions.php file where I included all the necessary functions.
- I created a custom post type and custom post fields. I initially developed the CPF from scratch, then recreated it using a plugin to demonstrate the differences.
- I developed custom forms from scratch using Ajax, including nonce protection.
- I implemented SMTP functionality instead of the basic PHP mailer to avoid emails going to spam, as WordPress uses a server that is not properly configured.
- I created a small shortcode to pull the latest CPT (Custom Post Types) and demonstrated how it works.
- Finally, I developed a custom search feature for CPT cars.

Creating a WordPress theme from scratch can be divided into several key steps. Hereâ€™s how the process might look:

1.Creating the Basic Theme Structure:
    - Create a directory for your theme in the wp-content/themes folder.
    - Within that directory, create the basic files such as style.css, index.php, functions.php, and screenshot.png (to display the theme in the WordPress admin panel).

2.Adding Basic Styles and Scripts:
    - In the style.css file, define the basic styles for your theme.
    - In the functions.php file, register and enqueue the necessary styles and scripts using functions like wp_enqueue_style() and wp_enqueue_script().

3.Creating Basic Templates:
    - Create basic page templates such as header.php, footer.php, sidebar.php, page.php, single.php, and archive.php.
    - Use WordPress functions in the templates, such as get_header(), get_footer(), get_sidebar(), and the_content() to generate content.

4. Adding Functionality via functions.php:
    - In the functions.php file, add custom functions, widgets, menus, and other elements needed for your theme.
    - Create custom post types (CPT) and custom fields if your theme requires specific functionalities.

5. Styling and Responsiveness:
    - Style your theme using SCSS or CSS preprocessors like Sass, and then automatically generate styles using tools like Gulp.
    - Ensure that your theme is responsive and adapts to different devices.

6. Testing and Optimization:
    - Test your theme on different devices and browsers to ensure consistent display.
    - Optimize resource loading (minifying CSS and JS, optimizing images, etc.).

7. Creating Additional Functionalities:
    - Add custom shortcodes, AJAX functionalities, custom forms, and other advanced functionalities specific to your theme.

8. Preparing for Distribution:
    - Make sure the theme is ready for distribution, including code review, documentation, and testing on different versions of WordPress.
    - If you plan to distribute the theme, prepare user documentation to help users properly use and customize your theme.
